NeuroCrypto
===========
This work is the software implementation of the concept of neural cryptography, which is a communication of two tree parity machines for agreement on a common key over a public channel. This key is utilized to encrypt a sensitive message to be transmitted over an insecure channel using Rijndael cipher. This is a new potential source for public key cryptography schemes which are not based on number theoretic functions, and have small time and memory complexities.
